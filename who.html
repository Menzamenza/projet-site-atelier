                Our story began in 2005, when two travelers, Alon Farber and Marie-Josée Richer, fell in love and returned to Quebec after meeting in India, where they had started a vegan seasonal restaurant in Goa. Driven by a desire to have positive impact on people lives and respond to social and environmental issues, they used entrepreneurship as a driver of change by sharing their love of food and passion for healthy nutrition.  Modestly, they started out roasting nuts in Marie-Josée's mom's kitchen and selling their tasty treats through word-of-mouth and farmer's markets.  With consumers support and love, the business took off and Prana today touches people from East to West, being an organic industry leader and Canada's # 1 organic snack brand.
